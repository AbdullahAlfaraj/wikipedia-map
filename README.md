# wikipedia-map
See it at [luke.deentaylor.com/wikipedia](http://luke.deentaylor.com/wikipedia/)

A web app for visualizing the connection of wikipedia pages. Start by entering a topic into the text box, i.e. *Cats*. A single node will be generated, labeled *Cat*. Double-click this node to expand it.

 Expanding a node creates a new node for each page that  is linked to from the first paragraph of the article. These nodes will be connected to the node from which they were expanded. For example, expanding *Cat* will create eight nodes, including *Fur*, *Mammal*, *Carnivore*, and *Domestication*, each of which will be connected to *Cat*. Each of these nodes can also be expanded in the same way.

 I've chosen to use links only from the first paragraph of an article for 2 reasons:

 1. There is usually a managable number of these links, about 5-10 per page.
 2. They tend to be more directly relevant to the article than links further down in the page.

A map typically looks like this:

 Note that nodes are lighter in color when they are farther away from the central node. If it took 5 steps to reach *Ancient Greek* from *Penguin*, it will be a lighter color than a node like *Birding*, which only took 2 steps to reach. Thus, in general, a node's color indicates how strongly related to the central topic an article is, with less-strongly related topics having lighter color.

Single-clicking a node will highlight in blue the path back to the central node.

# Cloning
Note: If you want to clone this, you'll have to replace the `github-markdown.css` file with the file at the link, and you'll have to manually create the `libraries` folder. This repo is designed to reflect only the code that I've actually written, as much as possible.

# How it works

### API
When you double click a node, a request is made to a Flask server (under the `api` directory). The Flask server provides a wrapper around code from my Python script, `wikipedia_parse.py`. The API json-izes the results from `wikipedia_parse.py` and serves them. The resulting API is at [luke.deentaylor.com/wikipedia/api](http://luke.deentaylor.com/wikipedia/api). The main functionality is getting first paragraph links, by making a request like http://luke.deentaylor.com/wikipedia/api/links?page=Cats.

### HTML Parsing
The underlying script, in `wikipedia_parse.py`, uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse through the HTML of wikipedia pages. It looks for the `<div>` element with an `id` of `mw-content-text`, which contains page content. Then, it finds the first `<p>` tag directly under that, excluding the coordinates which are sometimes at the top right. Under this tag, it simply looks at all links, and extracts the page title from each of these links.

### The main page
I suck at JavaScript, which is why I wrote a lot of the underlying code in Python. However, the main page is written mostly in JavaScript. It uses `vis.js` to display the graph. Every time a node is double-clicked, it uses `jQuery` to make an ajax request to the Flask API. The results are word-wrapped with [wordwrap](phpjs.org/functions/wordwrap)), and then stuck on nodes which are colored with [tinycolor](github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) (Honestly, the use of `jQuery`, `tinycolor` and `wordwrap` is *so* trivial that I'll probably just write it out in future versions. I used them temporarily to save me time writing it. :)

# To Do (Sorted by priority)
- [x] Build an interface
  - [x] Change input method to something other than prompt
  - [x] Allow starting anew without refreshing page
  - [x] Create small info button that explains the project, controls, etc.
    - [x] Render this README into the help dialog
- [x] single clicking on a node will show a traceback of how you arrived at that node, kind of like breadcrumbs. This will be accomplished by highlighting all nodes and edges taken in blues, instead of oranges.
	- [x] Only highlight edges directly in the path
- [x] mobile optimization
- [ ] Improve efficiency of highlighting the nodes
    - This will allow for swapping events around, at least on desktop, so that single-clicking will expand and hovering will highlight the path back.
- [x] `.gitignore`-ify the libraries directory, no reason for it to be in here when I didn't write that stuff.
- [ ] Remove dependance on libraries
	- [x] jQuery
	- [ ] wordwrap
	- [ ] tinycolor
- [x] Move JavaScript to separate files from HTML
- [ ] Make API requests asynchronous

# Credits
Powered mainly by [vis.js](visjs.org) and [BeautifulSoup](crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), with only minor usage of other libraries ([tinycolor](github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) and [wordwrap](phpjs.org/functions/wordwrap)).
Rendering of this document into the help modal is done via a modified version of [marked](github.com/chjj/marked) that supports task lists.
